## whoami / what's this

I'm **Nika Kharebava**, this is a repository documenting everything I do regarding Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering and related lower level programming...  
Hopefully helping others digest some topics too, other than just me demonstrating my experience and work done.
Yes, I don't like github-pages and jekyll that much...

**Revisiting Malware** :microbe:  
In this series I intend to make writeups about older and newer malwares, which I might have already analyzed but hadn't published anything before so this is mostly series dedicated to revisigint some malwares which I've analysed before.
- [Revisiting PlugX](/_writeups/RevisitingMalware/RevisitingPlugx.md)

**Misc** :package:	
- [Understanding calling conventions](/_writeups/_misc/UnderstandingCallingConventions.md) - calling conventions 101, explained different calling conventions with examples.
- [Dealing with InnoSetup Malwares](/_writeups/_misc/DealingWithInnoSetup.md) - InnoSetup is a utility which is used by malwares, thus it needs a bit of a different approach to analyze.
- [VolumeInformationUSBCryptoStealer](/_writeups/_misc/VolumeInformationUSBCryptoStealer.md) - This was one of the interesting malwares in terms of tricking user, not technically.
